This is a simple representation of the 'Tower of Hanoi' puzzle made in C

From Wikipedia: The Tower of Hanoi (also called The problem of Benares Temple, Tower of Brahma or Lucas' Tower, and sometimes pluralized as Towers, or simply pyramid puzzle) is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:
  1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
  2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
  3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

With three disks, the puzzle can be solved in seven moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.

The game receive two types of Input:
  1. An integer, which is how many tiles in the game
  2. A pair of integers, one of them is the column of origin and the other is the destination of a given tile

# Important
There are two versions of the same code, with a minor difference. One was made for Windows, and the other was for Linux and MacOS. It was necessary since the command for clearing the terminal is different from one another.
